Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
    Software Engineering is the application of engineering principles, methods & tools to the development & maintenance of high quality software systems.
    Importance :
        - It ensbles creation of software applications & systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment & healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
    The Emergence of Structured Programming (1960s-1970s)
        This emphasized the use of control structures like loops, conditionals, and subroutines to create clear, well-organized, and easy-to-follow code.
    The Development of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) (1970s-1980s)
        Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm that organizes software design around objects, which are instances of classes that encapsulate data and behavior. OOP was developed to better manage the complexity of large software systems by promoting reuse, modularity, and abstraction.
    The Rise of Agile Methodologies (1990s-2000s)
        Agile methodologies emerged as a response to the limitations of traditional, heavyweight software development processes, such as the Waterfall model. Agile emphasizes iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility, with the goal of delivering high-quality software more quickly and efficiently.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
    - Requirements - involves gathering & documenting user needs & system requirements.
    - Design - involves creating high level & detailed designs of software architecture & User Interface.
    - Implementation - involves writing of code & building the software according to design specifications.
    - Testing - involves conducting various tests to ensure software meets quality standards & functional requirements.
    - Deployment - involves releasing the software to users/customers.
    - Maintenance - involves providing ongoing support, updates & enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
    Waterfall - this is a sequential approach distinct phases flowing downwards like a waterfall
        Example is developing software for healthcare needs.
    Agile - involves an iterative & incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration & responding to change.
        Example is for a continous delivery of software updates is needed.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
    Software Developer - responsible for writing code & implementing software solutions.
    Quality Assurance Engineer - ensures software quality by designing & executing test plans.
    Project Manager - Oversees planning, execution & delivery pf software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
    Integrated Development Environments provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging & testing code e.g Visual Studio.
    Version Control Systems provide a platform for tracking changes to source code & co-ordinating work among team members e.g Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
    Tight Deadlines - can result in rushed development & compromised quality. It's tackled by trying to share the workload where applicablemto help complete the task on time.
    Technical Debt - can impede future development efforts & increase maintenance costs. Tackled by conducting code reviews, reffactoring of code to improve its structure & reduce its complexity.
    Changing Requirements - this leads to scope creep & project delays. Tackled by making sure all the needs required by the software are well noted early enough to avoid delay of projects.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
     Unit Testing - this is the testing of individual components or modules of a software application in isolation.
        Importance -  it enables developers to catch software bugs early enough.
    Integration Testing - involves testing the interaction between different units or modules of the software to ensure they work together as expected.
        Importance - it ensures functionality of code in synchrony.
    System Testing -  involves testing the complete and integrated software application as a whole.
        Importance - it enables developers to deliver the required application that is in full functionality that is working as required without any bugs.
    Acceptance Testing - this is where the software is tested from the user's perspective to determine whether it is ready for release.
        Importance - It enables developers to know the level of quality from the application.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
    Prompt Engineering is the deliberate crafting of input prompts to AI models to influence their outputs. It focuses on designing prompts that guide AI systems to generate desired responses or behaviour.
    Importance - It allows deelopers to shape the behaviour of AI models, enabling them to produce more accurate, relevant & human-like responses.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
    Vague Prompt - "Provide code for addition"
    Improved prompt - "Provide code in Python Programming Language for addition of two numbers"
    The improved is more effective since the prompt specifies the programming language the task of addition is needed to be done in, the clarity in what is needed to be added i.e numbers.
